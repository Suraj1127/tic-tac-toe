# tic-tac-toe
Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax AI algorithm.

## Short Description:

The repository is implementation of AI in Tic Tac Toe game using Minimax algorithm.

## Requirements:
- Python 3
- tkinter (Python GUI library)
- Numpy (Python scientific computing library)

## Instructions:
* Run python program tic_tac_toe.py and start the program.
* Play the first move and AI plays the next move.  After human's each move, AI move would be automatically played.

## Further Possible Improvements:
* Here, first player is always set to human.  We can have user set the configurations.
* No of steps is not taking while calculating evaluation function/state.  We can take it into account.  Though for this game, it is not super useful, but for other complex games like chess, bagchal, etc, it is mandatory to finish up the game sooner.
